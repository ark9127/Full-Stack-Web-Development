Q2. Explain the purpose of comments  in HTML and provide an example of how to use comments in a HTML document?
Solution 2:
    The purpose of comments in HTML, not rendered by the browser, is to provide the context of the block or piece of written code. 
    It helps in following ways:
     - Documentation: brief description on the code helps developer to quickly understand the task performed by the given piece of code without actually going through It
     - Debugging: By commenting a piece of code can also help developer to debug or test the remaining code
     - Reminder: can be used as reminder for future references, during maintenance, enhancement, or completing unfinished code

     Example:
     1. Single Line Comments
      <!-- Single Line Comment -->

     2. Multiple Line Comments
      <!-- Multiple
            Line
            Comments -->
