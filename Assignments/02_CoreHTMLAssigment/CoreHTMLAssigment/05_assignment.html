                    <dd>A CSS framework is a prepped and ready-to-use CSS library (Cascading Style Sheets). The stylesheets collection makes the job of a UI developer easier. Rather than starting every project from scratch, a CSS framework gives them tools to quickly create a user interface that they repeat and tweak during a project.</dd>
                    <dt><b>Version Control System</b></dt>
                    <dd>Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time</dd>
                    <dt><b>JavaScript</b></dt>
                    <dd>JavaScript is a scripting language used to develop web pages. Developed in Netscape, JS allows developers to create a dynamic and interactive web page to interact with visitors and execute complex actions. It also enables users to load content into a document without reloading the entire page</dd>
                    <dt><b>DSA</b></dt>
                    <dd>DSA stands for Data Structures and Algorithms. It is also sometimes referred to as PSDS - Problem Solving Data Structures. DSA is applied in problem-solving and enables developers to learn to write efficient code</dd>
                    <dt><b>ReactJS</b></dt>
                    <dd>The React. js framework is an open-source JavaScript framework and library developed by Facebook. It's used for building interactive user interfaces and web applications quickly and efficiently with significantly less code than you would with vanilla JavaScript</dd>

                    <dd>NodeJS is a javascript runtime environment for running JavaScript programs and is used to build server-side applications. ExpressJS is a web framework that enables you to design a web application to handle a variety of different HTTP demands. You can use NodeJS to build a multi-user, real-time web service.</dd>
